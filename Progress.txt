Started sampler base. Might need to implement "main" running class to be able to
get overview of the complete problem space.

Main runner class: 
	Takes a model class that has the functions: 
			- Give parameters and train. Returns performance 
			  metrics for trained models
			- Somehow implement live feedback, which can be feeded to
			  early stopping functions

	Takes evaluator functions/classes which evaluates performance metrics
			- Eventually implement directly into model class
			- Both live training performance and final performance metrics
	
	Takes paramConfig which it creates rescaler_functions for.

	Take samplers (maybe rename to suggestors) for suggesting parameters

	Should log/save models and the performance
